# Spoti-WhatsApp-Integration
Programm written in Year 10 (Original file created 18 ‎September ‎2023)
Program written using the Selenium library and the Spotify API to update my WhatsApp status to my Spotify listening status in real time.
Selenium is used to create a headless chrome instance to interface the WhatsApp Web API.
Be warned that this program might break the WhatsApp ToS - I am not resposible if your account gets banned or you lose any data.
