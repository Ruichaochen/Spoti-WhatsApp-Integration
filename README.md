# Spoti-WhatsApp-Integration
Program written at the beginning of Year 11 (Original file created 18 ‎September ‎2023)  
Program written using the Selenium library and the Spotify API to update my WhatsApp status to my Spotify listening status in real time.  
Selenium is used to create a headless chrome instance to interface the WhatsApp Web API.  
Be warned that this program might break the WhatsApp ToS - I am not resposible if your account gets banned or you lose any data.  

Example config.json file:
```
wait_floor = 2
wait_ceil = 5
headless = True
CLIENT_ID = "CLIENT_ID_HERE"
CLIENT_SECRET = "CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
REFRESH_TOKEN = "REFRESH_TOKEN_HERE"
```
Ensure you set sensible wait floor and ceiling values, as setting these values too low will lead to ratelimiting.  
Client ID, Client Secret, and refresh tokens can be generated by following the [Spotify Developer Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) (Read the "Getting started" section) and read this [article](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-flow) to get a refresh token.
